       ears and mind but also nurturing for the soul. It has been 
       long said that music gives one an emotional response. Music 
       an raise someoneâ€™s mood, get them excited, or make them calm
        and relaxed. Music also - and this is important - allows us 
        to feel nearly or possibly all emotions that we experience
        in our lives. The possibilities are endless.
